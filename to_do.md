# Tasks to do
- [ ] Get all the plots into github 
	**AA:** Missing files for reproducibility (if we want to host them here, discussion is open - so far the Martin files, for example, are hosted in google drive and incorporated into the scripts with a custom command):

			- [ ] Enhancers
			- [ ] New/old BAZ1B lists
			- [ ] GTEx files

	Missing plots:

			- [X] GTEX (25)
			- [ ] Peyregné (1/10)
			
- [X] Plot both introgression files (Vernot vs Sankararaman)
	+ **AA:** If you have any other suggestions re that let me know
- [X] Divide between Denisovan and Neanderthals in the Martin files (and plot)
	+ **AA:** Done using NNall and columns 7, 10 and 13 for the filter specifically. Looks like it should. I'd say stats should be robust on the earlier peak with Neanderthals vs Denisovan.
	- [ ] KS tests for Denisovan, if we want to mention this
- [X] Martin filter plots
	+ [ ] **CB** perhaps here too differences within archaics may matter? (1/10)
- [ ] Come up with a way to redo graphs a la Reich
- [ ] GO gene categories
	- [X] Select GO categories of interest
	- [ ] Run them through Expecto
	- [ ] Run stats test 
- [ ] Add all the current observations 
- [ ] Statistics for:
	- [ ] Deserts of introgression, Akey and Peyregné, also for length/excess
- [ ] Add more here

Note: when a task is complete just add an upper-case X to the box, like this:

```md
- [X] Completed task 
+ **AA:** Here's an example comment on this task
