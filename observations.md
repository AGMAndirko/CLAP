# CLAP project: structured observations 
(right now unstructured, but ought to be structured as we add them)

Report all the statistically significant distributions (Nall, HF, HFstrict, etc.) LIST all statistically significant results here

All the curves tend to look like a Brontosaurus profile, except for missense where the right bump and left bump have equal height

BAZ1B targets: INV vs DIR contrast but mostly for most robust targets -- useful to bring up H. antcessor, but also Gokhman

Domestication vs Globularization timing vindicated; Tom vindicated

mention of 4th genome?

Not sure what to do with cortical enh/prom changes from Juan's paper, maybe in SI?

Not sure what to do with chromosome data (ask Martin?)

As predicted by Kuhlwilm and Boeckx, the curve of excess follows that of pos selection more closely than length does; introgression deserts from Akey also follows pos selection closely -- these 3 curves are different ways of giving sense to "most distinctive" variants
