# CLAP project: structured observations 

## Core files
As predicted by Kuhlwilm and Boeckx, the curve of excess follows that of positive selection more closely than length does; introgression deserts from Akey also follows pos selection closely -- these 3 curves are different ways of giving sense to "most distinctive" variants
	+ **AA:** did we roll stats on it at some point? I don't remember doing it, and that's the short of statment that we should be very careful to back strongly

## Statistical results
Report all the statistically significant distributions (Nall, HF, HFstrict, etc.) LIST all statistically significant results here

All the curves tend to look like a Brontosaurus profile, except for missense where the right bump and left bump have equal height

## BAZ1B
BAZ1B targets: INV vs DIR contrast but mostly for most robust targets -- useful to bring up H. antcessor, but also Gokhman

Domestication vs Globularization timing vindicated; Tom vindicated

## Technical details
- Mention of 4th genome?
- Not sure what to do with chromosome data (ask Martin?)

## Enhancers / promoters
Not sure what to do with cortical enh/prom changes from Juan's paper, maybe in SI?
