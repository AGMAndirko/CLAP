# CLAP project: structured observations 

## Main messages


## Core files
As predicted by Kuhlwilm and Boeckx, the curve of excess follows that of positive selection more closely than length does; introgression deserts from Akey also follows pos selection closely -- these 3 curves are different ways of giving sense to "most distinctive" variants
	+ **AA:** did we roll stats on it at some point? I don't remember doing it, and that's the short of statment that we should be very careful to back strongly

## Statistical results
LIST all statistically significant results here

**KS test**: are certain distributions from the core files statistically significant?
- Recent distribution (0-300k years)
    - HF vs HF strict
    ```D = 0.039051, p-value = 4.328e-11 ```
    - ALL vs HF
     ```D = 0.037489, p-value < 2.2e-16 ```
    - ALL vs HF strict
     ```D = 0.043893, p-value < 2.2e-16 ```
- Older distribution (300k years to end of the tail):
    - HF vs HF strict
     ```D = 0.087302, p-value < 2.2e-16 ```
    - ALL vs HF
     ```D = 0.19197, p-value < 2.2e-16 ```
    - ALL vs HF strict
     ```D = 0.2469, p-value < 2.2e-16 ```

**Linear regression model**
A linear regression analysis shows that expression values as predicted by ExPecto are significantly different in the 0-60k, 200-300k and 300-500k blocks of time (p-values <0.05).The R2 is very low though - expertise in stats needed here.


**Back-to-back plot statistics - random sampling**
Approximative Kruskal-Wallis Test with random sampling (n = 1000)


All the curves tend to look like a Brontosaurus profile, except for missense where the right bump and left bump have equal height

## BAZ1B
BAZ1B targets: INV vs DIR contrast but mostly for most robust targets -- useful to bring up H. antcessor, but also Gokhman

Domestication vs Globularization timing vindicated; Tom vindicated

## Technical details
- Mention of 4th genome?
- Not sure what to do with chromosome data (ask Martin?)

## Enhancers / promoters 
Not sure what to do with cortical enh/prom changes from Juan's paper, maybe in SI?
