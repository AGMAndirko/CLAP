# GO Terms - gprofiler2

For the 0-300k period, terms related to post-synapse ('regulation of postsynapse organization', GO:0099175; 'postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor activity', GO:0098960), channel activity ('transmitter-gated channel activity', GO:0022835; 'ligand-gated channel activity', GO:0022834) stand out, while in the 300-500k period it exclusively appears heart/cardiac-related terms ('regulation of heart rate by cardiac conduction', GO:0086091; 'cardiac muscle cell action potential', GO:0086001). It is indeed in the late period (300 to 1my) where we find terms related to cardiomyopathy (KEGG:05412; KEGG:05410;KEGG:05414) or 'calcium regulation in the cardiac cell' (WP:WP536). Interestingly, the comparison early (0-300k) versus late (300k-1m) periods further shows differences in bone and cartilage related terms (skeletal system development, GO:0001501; chondrocyte differentiation, GO:0002062; collagen biosynthesis and formation, REAC:R-HSA-1650814 and REAC:R-HSA-1474290) or in the visual system (eye and visual system development, GO:0001654 and GO:0150063), exclusively found in the later periods (300 to 1my). 

Regarding signaling pathways, only in the first period we find 'cGMP-PKG signaling pathway' (KEGG:04022), while later 'oxytocin signaling pathway'(KEGG:04921) (300-500k period), 'cAMP signaling pathway' (KEGG:04024) or 'Pathways Regulating Hippo Signaling' (WP:WP4540) (500-1my period). Specific to the most recent period is the term related to the disorder 'Fragile X Syndrome' (WP:WP4549). Across all time blocks we recurrently find GO terms related to development and differentiation (including terms such as 'head development', GO:0060322; 'brain development', GO:0007420; or 'anatomical structure development', GO:0048856) and synapse (e.g. GABAergic/cholinergic/glutamatergic synapses, KEGG:04727, KEGG:04725, GO:0098978; or postsynapse, GO:0098794). Some specific terms for each period are shown in Figure X (see Suppl. Tables X1...Xn for the complete set of GO terms).

We further noticed differences between GO terms across periods when thresholding for a adj p-value < .05. Exclusively in the middle period (300-500k) we find terms related to behavior (startle response, GO:0001964), facial shape (narrow mouth, 'HP:0000160') and hormone system (steroid hormone, GO:0043401, GO:0048545, and GO:0003707; or parathyroid hormone, KEGG:04928). For the 500-1m period, we find cognition (GO:0050890), learning or memory (GO:0007611) or cerebellum (granular layer, HPA:007020_22; also present at adj p value < .01) and spinocerebellar ataxia (KEGG:05017). Only in the most recent period the term 'cerebral cortex: neuropil' appears (HPA:008050_22) (Suppl. Tables X1...Xn).
