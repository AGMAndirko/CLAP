# Outline
The _overall objective_ of the work, as I see it, is to uncover the temporal structure of the extendec catalog of single nucleotide changes distinguishing modern humans from archaic hominins of Kuhlwilm and Boeckx 2019, exploiting the opportunities afforded by the GEVA tool. The GEVA tool only considers modern variants. 
The first datapoint of this study is a contrast between all modern-specific (in the sense of not present in archaics) regardless of frequency vs those that are nearly fixed in the sense of Kuhlwilm and Boeckx (i.e., >90%). Mapping capacity of GEVA here is fairly good (80% of all HF variants). The only drawback is the poor mapping capacity of completely fixed variants. While this would be a problem for previous approaches which focused on completely fixed variants, the extended catalog used here, departing precisely from complete fixation for reasons discussed in the paper, is rich enough to capture important contrasts.  
Mapping capacity could have been better if we had not imposed a 2 source filtering. DISCUSS. / AA: However, the two source filtering has it's advantages, as highlighted by the GEVA paper: it "improve[s] the genealogical resolution from a wider distribution of independently sampled genomes". 
Plots assume a generation time of 29 years, as a convention. 
AA: Generation time only should affect the spread of the data, but not the nature of it.  

Additional plots: HF vs HFstrict (moving from a global HF to an HF filter for each population), variants in pos selection regions (Peyregne), genes with excess/length variants, variants in introgression deserts, and introgressed variants.
Basic plots reveal a 3 or 4 period division, used here to do the GO test analysis, probing the mosaic nature of the changes involved by highlighting period-specific GO terms (1 vs 2 vs 3; 1 vs (2-3) and additional combinations, to be captured as a Venn diagram. #AA: I don't think that comes from the plots themselves: the basic plots are clearly bimodal)

Further probing of the periods using Expecto; tissue specificity examined vi eQTL dataset and also touched upon in the contact of variant-kind specificity (enahncer, promotor, missense), tested for cerebellum, PFC and TC. 

Looking at specific genes, confirmation of a special Jebel period, and in general face > brain; main introgression even around 60k, but signs of introgression (in both directions) prior to 100k, some very old modern variants for face as well as some with excess mutations (discrepancies with Khaitovich, but also data about AHI1), refined nature of BAZ1B , recent face changes related to SOX9, selected variants tend to be recent (e.g. CADPS2, RUNX2, GLI3), missense variants as recent as regulatory changes, varaints associated with deepest population splits by Schlebusch et al are indeed old (<500k), some cerebellar specific genes  (ZIC4, GRID2, etc indeed cluster <100k as predicted by Gunz, so do variants for DAAM1 associated with precuneus and globularization
