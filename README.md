# CLAP
Here's a repository of all the data, observations, code and plots for the CLAP project. 
The structure of the folders is the following:
- `plots/` is self-explanatory. Subfolders are thematically organized.
- `code/` includes all the subtasks divided in thematic subscripts (f ex: a script for the generation of a specific set of plots). The products of these scripts in form of plots are found in matching subfolders - wordier results should go to `observations.md`.
- `observations.md` is the document we have mentioned before as we have discussed it before. I filled it with some of the points to mention, but I haven't finished it, just wrote some points we have mentioned to fill it. Once I have the plots in place I'll make it nicer.
- `to_do.md` includes a list of minitasks, accompanied by a due date and maybe a short description.


 Format considerations
- Text files are written in Markdown - if you need help with the syntax, here's a [quick cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
- I'm ordering a bit the scripts as well - should be done by tomorrow. I'm also running the procedure again to get the plots in place.
- Ideally, we should keep figures in PDF format.
- Apparently you can mention people (like in @AGMAndirko ) in specific bits, and they get a notification.
