# Fine-grained temporal mapping repository
Here's a repository of all the code and plots for the 'Fine-grained temporal mapping of derived high-frequency variants supports the mosaic nature of the evolution of Homo sapiens' article.
The structure of the folders is the following:
- `plots/` is self-explanatory. Subfolders are thematically organized.
- `code/` includes all the subtasks divided in thematic subscripts (e.g.: a script for the generation of a specific set of plots). The products of these scripts in form of plots are found in matching subfolders.

`code/KB19` forms the basis of the project and should set up the folder structure needed for the rest of the scripts to work.
