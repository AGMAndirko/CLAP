# CLAP
Here's a repository of all the data, observations, code and plots for the CLAP project. 
The structure of the folders is the following:
- `plots/` is self-explanatory.
- `code/` includes a series of unorganized scripts we have been using, and another folder that includes all the subtasks divided in thematic subscripts (f ex: a script for the generation of a specific set of plots) 
- `observations/` includes only a markdown document as we have discussed it before, including an organized document with plots contained in `plots/`
- `tasks/` includes a list of tasks to tacked, accompanied by a date and maybe a short description


 Format considerations
- Text files are written in Markdown - if you need help with the syntax, here's a [quick cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
- Ideally, we should keep figures in PDF format.
